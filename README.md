#  <font color='#57998f'>Taxi Trajectory Data | Machine Learning Application </font>

Current repository the final assignment in the context of **'Machine Learning'** course, <br> provided by MSc in Artificial Intelligence from NCSR Demokritos. 
The scope of the project is to apply machine learning techniques on a dataset. 
<br><br>
The project is structured in two Jupyter Notebooks, that contain the initial data preprocessing and the ML application on the data: 
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Machine Learning Application

The notebooks are reproducable, inside they have descriptions and steps followed for the project. 
<br>
On visualization folder, there are some map representation of the data. 

Dataset Reference:  
Taxi Service Trajectory - Prediction Challenge, [ECML PKDD](https://ecmlpkdd.org/) 2015 Data Set <br>
